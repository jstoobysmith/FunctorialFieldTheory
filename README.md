# Functorial Field Theory

Welcome to this repository dedicated to curating links to papers in the realm of functorial field theory. The goal is to present them in an organized manner while ensuring comprehensiveness. I recognize that there may/will be many missing papers. To contribute a paper, please submit a pull request or reach out directly to me. Additionally, any suggestions to enhance the layout are highly appreciated.

Papers may appear more than once, in different classes. This list will hopefully get more refined as time goes on. I appologize if insult is caused by wrong classification.
